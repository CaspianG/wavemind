# WaveMind Crypto Pattern Research

This branch explores whether WaveMind can be useful for market-pattern memory:
remembering historical OHLCV patterns, retrieving similar regimes, and using the
retrieved evidence for research-grade analysis.

This is not financial advice and not a trading system. The first goal is a
reproducible benchmark layer, not live prediction.

## Scope

WaveMind is not positioned as a replacement for a backtesting engine or exchange
connector. The useful role is narrower:

- convert OHLCV windows into compact pattern descriptions;
- store historical patterns with outcome metadata;
- retrieve similar past regimes for a new market window;
- compare retrieved outcomes against static vector baselines;
- later feed retrieved evidence into a proper backtest and risk model.

## First Benchmark

Runner:

```sh
python benchmarks/crypto_pattern_benchmark.py --engines wavemind static --history 250 --queries 60
```

What it measures:

- `direction_accuracy_at_1` - top match has the same next-move direction;
- `direction_accuracy_at_3` - any of top 3 matches has the same direction;
- `family_accuracy_at_1` - top match belongs to the same pattern family;
- `mean_abs_return_error_bps` - absolute error between expected and retrieved
  future return, in basis points;
- query latency.

The default dataset is deterministic synthetic OHLCV. It is intentionally not a
profit claim. It exists so every future change to the market-memory layer can be
tested before any real-data backtest is added.

Current synthetic result is checked in at
`benchmarks/crypto_pattern_results.json`. The first run is intentionally easy:
both WaveMind and the static vector baseline recover the deterministic pattern
families. Treat that as a scaffold validation, not evidence of market edge.

## Roadmap

1. Add real OHLCV CSV import with explicit train/test splits.
2. Add transaction costs, slippage, and walk-forward evaluation.
3. Compare against Chroma/Qdrant candidate retrieval.
4. Add signal construction only after retrieval quality is stable.
5. Publish results separately from the main README to avoid confusing memory
   benchmarks with market-performance claims.
